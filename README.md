# coding_challenge

## This are the tasks for the coding interview:
- Make yourself familiar with the data

### Data exploration

1. Clone repository and create new branch

2. Read-in the data

3. Perform EDA

4. Create some random labels for the dataset  (eyes open = 0, eyes closed = 1)


5. Compute features for each dataset: frequency band power

EEG Frequency bands
Delta: 2-4 Hz <br>
Theta: 5-7 Hz  <br>
Alpha: 8-12 Hz  <br>
Beta: 13 - 30 Hz  <br>

### Model exploration

6. Initialize and train model: binary SVM (use fitcsvm)


7. Evaluate model performance


8. Save trained model outputs to be re-used for 


9. Push your code to the repository and make a pull request to the main branch
